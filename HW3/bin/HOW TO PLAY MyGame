HOW TO PLAY THE GAME

The game is simple. You control the black rectangle 
(the goalie) on the bottom of the screen. You can
move either left or right using the arrow keys (you
can hold down the keys), but you cannot move up or 
down. There is a white ball (soccer ball) starting
at the top of the Field, and it will steadily move
toward the bottom of the Field (the goal).

The point of the game is to block the balls from
going into the goal (or hitting the bottom edge of
the field), by moving right and left to ‘catch’
the balls one at a time. If you miss a ball, there
is no penalty, however, the only way to win the
game is to catch 10 individual balls. 

After you have caught ten balls, the screen will
display “Game Over!!!”, and the game will be finished.
